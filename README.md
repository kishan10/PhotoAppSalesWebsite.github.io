Photo App Sales Website using Bootstrap
This Photo App Sales Website was made with BootStrap and contains three pages: Home, About, and Contact. The Home page is divided between the initial large jumbotron, and three columns for displaying content. The About page has a collapsible group for questions and answers about the photo app. The Contact page has a contact form that could easily be used to send messages to the app makers email. All pages have custom CSS to make them responsive to different screen sizes.
